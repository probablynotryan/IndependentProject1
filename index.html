  <p>Summary: <br>This exercise/project is to demonstrate what HTML/CSS skills I've learned in my first week of Epicodus!</p>
  <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
  <p>Class clown, musician, writer, hot sauce fanatic, tech junkie. Throughout my life, these have been a few of the ways I've tagged myself. Most recently, <em>"web developer"</em> has risen to the top of titles I'd like to see myself representing properly. And my family should have seen it coming; my dad has introduced me to <strong>BASIC</strong> in grade school, in middle school I took a class on HTML, in college I practiced <strong>Pascal</strong>, and thoroughout that entire time I've been learning <strong>Javascript, NodeJS, SQL,</strong> and a grip of frameworks both front and back-end. I hope to continue to learn and find a career in doing something I've enjoyed my entire life!</p>
  <h2><u>Background:</u></h2>
  <p>I've done everything from bartending to chopping down trees to installing home theater systems, and thoroughly enjoyed the things I've learned along the way. I also enjoyed the time I spent in college, but life circumstances made it difficult for me to follow-through and graduate. I started bartending to help pay off my debts before I find time to head back and graduate. When the pandemic started, the bar I was managing was shut down and most days became about twiddling my thumbs and waiting. I took that time to step back from the service industry and start back up on something I've always been really passion about: programming/coding. After working with a friend and professional web developer for a few months, I thought it was time that I joined Epicodus and really pushed toward getting a job in that industry. I'm excited to see where I am in a few months!</p>

  <h2><u>Ongoing Personal Projects:</u></h2>
  <p>There are two projects I'm particularly proud of that I've done or been involved in outside of class that shows my familiarity with things we're going to learn in the near future: NodeJS and SQL particularly, and a bunch of back-end frameworks. If you'd like to see them, be sure to let me know! Email me @ <a href ="mailto:theryanbass@gmail.com">theryanbass@gmail.com</a>!
