          <h3><u>Summary:</u></h2>
          <p>This project is to illustrate what HTML/CSS skills I've learned in my first week of Epicodus!</p>
          <h3><u>About Me:</u></h2>
          <p>Class clown, musician, writer, hot sauce fanatic, tech junkie. Throughout my life, these have been a few tags I've identified with. Most recently, however, <em>"web developer"</em> has risen to the top of titles I'd like to see myself representing properly. And my family should have seen it coming; my dad introduced me to BASIC in grade school, in middle school I took a class on HTML, in college I practiced Pascal, and thoroughout that entire time I've been learning Javascript, NodeJS, SQL, and a grip of frameworks both front and back-end. I hope to continue to learn and find a career in doing something I've enjoyed my entire life!</p>
          <h3><u>Background:</u></h2>
          <p>I've done everything from bartending to chopping down trees to installing home theater systems, and thoroughly enjoyed the things I've learned along the way. I also enjoyed my time spent in college! I then focused on taking care of my family and working as a bartender. When the <span class="pandemic">pandemic</span> started, the bar I was managing was shut down and most days became about twiddling my thumbs and waiting. I took that time to step back from the service industry and start back up on something I've always been really passion about: programming/coding. After working with a friend and professional web developer for a few months, I thought it was time that I joined Epicodus and <i>really</i> pushed toward getting a job in that industry. I'm excited to see where I am in a few months!</p>

It is still currently a work in progress, but it's given me time to better understand the KOA JS framework and DUST templates, as well as better familiarize myself with SQL and NodeJS.</li><br>
          </ul>
          <p>There are a couple other projects I'm particularly proud of that I've done or been involved in outside of class that shows my familiarity with things we're going to learn in the near future!
